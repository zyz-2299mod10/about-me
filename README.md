## Updating the Template

### Configuration

The template is designed to be easily customizable through the `src/config.ts` file. This single file controls:

- **Personal Information**: Name, title, description
- **Accent Color**: Primary color theme (changing this will change the accent color site wide)
- **Social Links**: Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub (all optional)
- **About Section**: Personal bio/description
- **Skills**: List of technical skills
- **Projects**: Project showcase with descriptions and links
- **Experience**: Work history with bullet points
- **Education**: Educational background and achievements
- **Moments**: List of moments (Whatever you want to show)

If skills, projects, experience, moments, or education are removed from the config, those sections will be hidden entirely.
